Letter 114: What is Tourvel’s tone? What does it reveal?

Letter 115: What is Valmont’s attitude towards Tourvel here? Do you think he’s putting on an act to show Merteuil that he is sticking to his libertine morals? Why doesn’t he want her to have an affair with Danceny? He volunteers himself as a way to assuage her boredom. “I already have a first inkling that the husband of my young pupil runs no danger of dying childless and that the future head of the house of Gercourt will be a scion of the house of Valmont” (p. 259) what does this mean?

(p. 281) Now Valmont wants Merteuil to devote herself to him.
