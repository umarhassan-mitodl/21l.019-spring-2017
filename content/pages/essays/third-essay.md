1.  _The Kiss of the Spider Woman_ is a novel that deals with power: political and sexual. Does Puig break conventional notions of power? To what degree? Support your argument with the text.
2.  The novel is, in part, a genre that teaches us how to live, how not to live, how to distinguish between good and evil; how to love; how to be a good friend, how people communicate and change through dialogue. Choose one or two specific dialogues from _The Kiss of the Spider Woman_ and explain why the novel is didactic—or not. Be specific.
3.  “The personal is political” was a theme of the 1960s. Can this saying be applied to _The Kiss of the Spider Woman_? Why or why not? To what point are our fantasies an important part of our political lives? Create a nuanced argument in your response.
4.  To what point does _The Kiss of the Spider Woman_ show how harmful conventional gender roles can be in terms of making autonomy impossible? How does the notion of being a “queen” limit Molina? How does his notion of what is “manly” limit Valentin? Does Molina’s sexual ideology change in the novel? Valentin’s? Create a nuanced argument based on the text.
